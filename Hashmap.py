"""
Hash maps are efficient key-value stores. 
They are capable of assigning and retrieving data in the fastest way possible for a data structure.
This is because the underlying data structure that they use is an array.
A value is stored at an array index determined by plugging the key into a hash function.

In Python we donâ€™t have an array data structure that uses a contiguous block of memory.
We are going to simulate an array by creating a list and keeping track of the size of the list 
with an additional integer variable.This will allow us to design something that resembles a hash map.
This is somewhat elaborate for the actual storage of a key-value pair, but it helps to remember that 
the purpose of this lesson is to gain a deeper understanding of the structure as it is constructed.
For real-world use cases in which a key-value store is needed, Python offers a built-in hash table 
implementation with dictionaries.
